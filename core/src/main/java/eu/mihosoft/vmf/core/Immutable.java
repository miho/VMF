/**
 * Entities annotated with this annotation are declared as being immutable, i.e., the state can only be set
 * during initialization via the builder pattern. The state is constant during the whole lifetime of an
 * immutable object. Consequently, it only provides getter methods for accessing its properties and only 
 * allows immutable property objects/types.
 * 
 * <h3>Example Model:</h3>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * package mypkg.vmfmodel;
 * 
 * import eu.mihosoft.vmf.core.*;
 * 
 * {@literal @}Immutable
 * interface ImmutableObject {
 *     int getValue();
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * The state of <b>{@code ImmutableObject}</b> instances can be defined via its associated builder:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * ImmutableObject obj = ImmutableObject.newBuilder().withValue(123).build();
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * The <b>{@code value}</b> property of {@code obj} cannot be changed anymore.
 * 
 * As an example, the following code will not compile:
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * ImmutableObject obj = ImmutableObject.newInstance();
 * obj.setValue(); // there is no setter method
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
 * 
 * VMF uses shared immutable instances for cloning. That is, while state changes of immutable 
 * properties require new instantiations (which might be performance critical) they can improve
 * the performance and memory footprint of cloning since immutable references can be shared.
